# Queen of Denmark - New Years Speeches: Web scraping and NLP-project

A visualization project by Alexander Ibsen Dernild & Max Festersen Hansen.

"Topics can be hard to document correctly.
By using this tool, you can find relevant topics and the words within on the topics tab.
From there you can then choose to explore the sentiment, countries, or statistics to get a better understanding of the topic.
You could also do your own thing and look at pretty graphs and statistics. We won't judge."
